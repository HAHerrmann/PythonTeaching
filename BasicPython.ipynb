    "## Python Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a (very) basic python tutorial covering a (very) simple introduction to programming. \n",
    "If you want to download a basic python console to try some of the coding examples yourself you can do so from [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comment**: can be written anywhere in the code and needs to be preceded by a hashtag (#). Good code should be commented so that others can easily follow it! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable**: storage container that holds information. We assign variables to give a descriptive name to the information that we are working with. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String**: a data type used in programming that is used to represent text rather than numbers. Strings must be written in quotation marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Float**: represent real numbers written with a decimal point. By default python considers everything as integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List**: a variable containing multiple other variables. A tool to store multiple pieces of information at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Statement**: statement used to iterate through each element in a list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If Statement**: selects only those items that fit a specified criteria. It is most commonly used to write code that says: \"If this is true then to that\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **While Statement**: carry out a specified task for as long as a specified condition holds. Once the condition is no longer true, the statement is no longer applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Library (aka Package)**: a collection of resources for other programmers to access. Often the code you are looking for has already been written by someone else! \n",
